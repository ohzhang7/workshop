1. They wanted to predict population through the use of different physical factors and other factors to 
2. Random forest population models are non-parametric and nonlinear and uses ensemble methods to learn by itself. The overall process is 
by combining multiple individual decision trees into one to make it much stronger and more capable. The basic process involves taking a
sample and then creating decisions trees with integration of variables. After all the trees are assembled, it is then possible to predict
a weighting layer and then redistribute the population to create a real map
3. Dasymetric population allocation is the use of different kinds of data such as land cover to help distribute data within a chosen 
boundary. Dasymetric population allocation divides the area within the set boundaries into specific area. It also removes uninhabitable
areas, such as oceans and other inhabitable areas. This allows for better depictions and more accurate population distribution mappping.
4. According to the article, the geospatial covariates that were the most important in urban and suburban areas and proxy classes.
Transportation networks and facilities were also deemed important because such transportation involves the movement of people. Rivers and
other waterways were also considered as they are also possible means of transporation.
